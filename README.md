# Illumio-Coding-Challenge

Illumio Coding Assignment

1.	The Data structure used is dictionary as we can have faster lookup to the input rules as time and space complexity are key in the given problem. It takes O(1) lookup time.
2.	If given more time I would have implemented unit tests. Due to assumptions input data is valid but we could check input conditions so as to keep up with the standard form.
3.  'n' test cases and 'n' input rules had been generated using respective scripts and tested. Few edge cases were tested manually.   
4.	We could expose firewall analyzer as a service and internally have a multithreaded architecture with caching to give high performance since input size could be 500K - 1M or more as stated in the assignment.
